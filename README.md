# Data Cleansing and Missing Value Treatment Tutorial

An in-depth guide to effective data cleaning and handling missing values in real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial for data cleaning and missing value treatment, tailored for analysts and data scientists. The tutorial uses a telecommunications dataset, emphasizing practical techniques and strategies to tackle common data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent indexing, and mismatched column names. 

The project is divided into two parts to ensure a thorough exploration of each topic:
- **Part 1:** Techniques for handling missing values
- **Part 2:** Data type adjustments, outlier treatment, and final dataset preparation

By following this tutorial, users will gain valuable experience in addressing complex data challenges and implementing best practices for data cleaning.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project, sourced from [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com), includes over 150,000 records and is tailored for predictive modeling tasks. Common data issues, such as missing values and outliers, are addressed throughout the tutorial to provide a realistic data-cleaning experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `watermark`

To install missing packages, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib watermark
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Cleansing-and-Missing-Value-Treatment-Tutorial.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Cleansing-and-Missing-Value-Treatment-Tutorial
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the tutorial:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_cleansing_tutorial.ipynb
   ```

## Tutorial Outline

1. **Overview**  
   An introduction to data cleaning and handling missing values in real-world scenarios.
   
2. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and perform initial checks to understand its structure and issues.

3. **Handling Missing Values**  
   Multiple techniques for treating missing values, including column removal, forward and backward fill, and categorical value imputation.

4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**  
   Methods for identifying and treating outliers to ensure robust data analysis.

5. **Data Type Adjustments**  
   How to adjust data types to align with the intended analysis.

6. **Final Dataset Preparation**  
   Preparing a clean and usable dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Usage

Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook `data_cleansing_tutorial.ipynb` sequentially, following the explanations and instructions. Code comments and output will guide you through each step of data cleaning and handling missing values.
